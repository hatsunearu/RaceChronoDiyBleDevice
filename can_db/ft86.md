# FT86 cars (Subaru BRZ, Toyota 86, Scion FR-S)

Here is information on some of the PIDs that you're most likely to use with
RaceChrono and equations to get the right scale, etc.

## PID 0xD0

Update frequency: 50 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation
------- | -------------------
Steering angle | bytesToIntLe(raw, 0, 2) * 0.1
Z rate of rotation | bytesToIntLe(raw, 2, 2) * -0.318309886
??? | bytes 4, 5
Lateral acceleration | bytesToIntLe(raw, 6, 1) * 0.2
Longitudinal acceleration | bytesToIntLe(raw, 7, 1) * -0.1
Combined acceleration | sqrt(pow2(bytesToIntLe(raw, 6, 1) * 0.2) + pow2(bytesToIntLe(raw, 7, 1) * 0.1))

## PID 0xD1

Update frequency: 50 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation | Notes
------- | ------------------- | -----
Speed | bytesToIntLe(raw, 0, 2) * 0.01569358787 | May want to check the multiplier against an external GPS device
Brake position | min(C / 0.7, 100) | The third byte is the pressure in the brake system, in Bars. The 0.7 divider seems to be a good value to get 100% at pressure slightly higher than those you're likely to use on the track for cars with no aero. You can use 0.8 or 0.9 if you see 100% too often.

# PID 0xD4

Update frequency: 50 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation | Notes
------- | ------------------- | -----
Wheel speed FL | bytesToIntLe(raw, 0, 2) * 0.01569358787 | Use same multiplier as for speed in 0xD1
Wheel speed FR | bytesToIntLe(raw, 2, 2) * 0.01569358787 | Use same multiplier as for speed in 0xD1
Wheel speed RL | bytesToIntLe(raw, 4, 2) * 0.01569358787 | Use same multiplier as for speed in 0xD1
Wheel speed RR | bytesToIntLe(raw, 6, 2) * 0.01569358787 | Use same multiplier as for speed in 0xD1

# PID 0x140

Update frequency: 100 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation | Notes
------- | -------------------
Accelerator position | A / 2.55
Clutch position | (B & 0x80) / 1.28 | On/off only
Engine RPM | C + (D & 63) * 256
??? | E
Throttle position | F / 2.55 | Not tested
??? | G
??? | H

# PID 0x141

Update frequency: 100 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation | Notes
------- | -------------------
Gear | G & 0xF | Not tested much. The value seems to jump so much that the usefulness is questionable.

Given how frequently 0x141 messages are sent, I presume there's a lot more
interesting info there.

# PID 0x360

Update frequency: 20 times per second.

Channel | RaceChrono equation
------- | -------------------
Engine oil temperature | C - 40
Coolant temperature | D - 40
